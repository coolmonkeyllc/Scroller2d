# Scroller2d
Scroller2d is an api interface and visual level editor that allows a developer to quickly create 2d SpriteKit games with minimal effort.

Are you looking for an easy to use SpriteKit helper that lowers anxiety and increases productivity?  Scroller2d allows you to quickly use helper objects, a visual editor, and defined configuration data to provide all the tools necessary unleash your inner creative.

Building a game is a time consuming and difficult task. You need to bring together many different elements such as visual assets, game play strategy, challenges, and above all the code to bring this all together. This is where Scroller2d attempts to help accelerate your ideas by providing a framework and visual editor to create levels in a data driven approach that allows you to modularize your game level core logic.

Every level has repeatable core principles: background, floor (horizontal scrolling), enemies, obstacles, collectibles, checkpoints, and artifacts, etc.

Using the data models only without the visual editor, classes, or object creators is free. You will never have to pay to organize your ideas and put them into action.
